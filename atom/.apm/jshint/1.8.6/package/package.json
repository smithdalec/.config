See [linter-jshint](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-jshint) for an alternative. However, I would strongly recommend trying out [ESLint](http://eslint.org) ([Atom plugin](https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-eslint)) instead. It's just so much better than JSHint. [XO](https://github.com/sindresorhus/xo) ([Atom plugin](https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-linter-xo)), which is an ESLint wrapper with sensible defaults, is also a good choice.\n\n---\n\n# JSHint\n\n> Validate JavaScript with [JSHint](http://jshint.com)\n\n![](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/170270/3834266/54ad6b1c-1daf-11e4-9c46-98e6e4abab07.png)\n\n\n## Install\n\n```\n$ apm install jshint\n```\n\nOr Settings â†’ Install â†’ Search for `jshint` *(install `Jshint`, not `Atom Jshint`)*\n\n\n## Features\n\n- Validates in realtime.\n- Line and line number turns red on error.\n- Hover over the line number to see the errors.\n- Displays the error from the current line or the first error in the statusbar; clicking the statusbar message moves the cursor to the error.\n- Reads your `.jshintrc` config and `jshintConfig` in package.json using the same logic as JSHint.\n- Option to only validate on save.\n- Command `Jshint: Lint` to manually lint.\n- Command `Jshint: Go To Next Error` to move the cursor to the next error in the current editor.\n- Command `Jshint: Go To Error` to move the cursor to the error displayed in the statusbar.\n- Supports [React JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html). *(must be enabled in Settings)*\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Sindre Sorhus](https://sindresorhus.com)\n","readmeFilename":"readme.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-jshint/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/sindresorhus/atom-jshint#readme","_id":"jshint@1.8.6","_shasum":"93e8a17473404f678e33b37fb160dcb107addf5e","_resolved":"file:../d-116730-1410-1vr9hk8/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116730-1410-1vr9hk8/package.tgz"}

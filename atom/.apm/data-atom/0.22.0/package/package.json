It supports autocomplete and exploring database information (tables, columns, views, etc.). The plan is to build it out with more data management functionality.\n\nFeel free to open issues or make pull requests!\n\n![Data Atom](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/156625/15249612/ccd377b0-1963-11e6-88ad-42eee914fc38.gif)\n\n##Features\n- Supports\n  - PostgreSQL\n  - Microsoft SQL Server\n  - MySQL (Beta support, see issues for known problems)\n- Execute custom queries or a whole file\n  - Separate results for each file/editor view\n  - Different connections per editor view\n- Autocomplete for table and column names\n- Easily change the database/connection to execute against\n- View meta information (tables, columns, views, etc.) for the connected database\n- Check the execution time in the right of the status bar\n- Save connections for easily connecting later\n\n##Usage\n- `F5` or 'Data Atom: Execute' command\n  - Executes the current query source (see below) against the current connection. It will prompt if there is no current connection\n  - Only executes the selected text if there is any\n- `CMD`+`ALT`+`R` (Mac), `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`R` (Windows, Linux) or the 'Data Atom: Toggle Results View' command\n  - Toggle results view\n- `ALT`+`SHIFT`+`D` or the 'Data Atom: Toggle Details View' command\n  - Toggle the database details view, showing table, column, view, etc. information\n\n###Other commands\n- 'Data Atom: Toggle Query Source' or the button right of 'Execute' on the toolbar\n  - Toggle the source of the query to execute between the active editor content and Data Atom's own query editor\n  - Allows you to easily work with SQL files in the main editor or quickly execute queries while working in any file type\n- 'Data Atom: New Query'\n  - Switch to use Data Atom's query input and focus to the keyboard there\n- 'Data Atom: New Connection'\n  - Launch the new connection dialog to add a new connection\n- 'Data Atom: Toggle Query Source'\n  - Toggle the source of the query between the active editor content (or selection) and Data Atom's own query input\n- 'Data Atom: Edit Connections'\n  - Open the saved connections file for editing\n\n##Contributing\nPlease do :)\n- It is written in ES6 using Babel (provided by Atom)\n- I am slowing moving callbacks I control to `Promise`s\n- Looking at implementing support for your favorite DB?\n  - Check out `data-manager.js` for what you need to implement\n  - See `postgres-manager.js` for the most complete example\n\n##The Random TODO list\n- Replace grid with something better to allow row selection, column selection etc.\n- Manage saved connections\n- Add support for other database systems. Submit an issue or comment on one already there so we know the priorities\n- More database information and visualisation e.g.\n  - Exploring relations, views, etc.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/lukemurray/data-atom/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/lukemurray/data-atom#readme","_id":"data-atom@0.22.0","_shasum":"07c4d5df8720dc1d637612439165c2f888add63f","_resolved":"file:../d-11674-27312-rsie3y/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11674-27312-rsie3y/package.tgz"}
